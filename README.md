# Matdaankendra
In India we have a centralized database of citizens in the form of Aadhar. We can use this existing database to authenticate and authorize the voter without having the need to recollect the data. From the Aadhar database a blockchain is constructed using the azure platform. This blockchain will be used for various voting related process on the Matdaankendra. The Matdaankendra 

## Registration and applying for VoterId
The registration process on the Matdaankendra is fully automated. The Matdaankendra looks at the new records being created on the Aadhar block chain and creates a voter record based on the details in the Aadhar. If there is any citizen who is under 18 years, a transaction with 'lock time' is generated which creates a record on the voting blockchain; on the day the citizen turns 18 as he/she gets eligible for voting after 18. A blockchain is maintained where all the voter details are present. Whenever a new entry is added in the Aadhar it adds it to the voter blockchain. In this way a new user need not intiate the process of voter id registration. It would be automatically completed which would remove the procrastination on the citizen side.

## Missing Voter details
As there is an immutable ledger being maintained the voter details would never be missed as they would always be on the log. 

## Different location problem
The Matdaankendra provides a smart contract where the user will be allowed to vote from anywhere with his details on the blockchain. The Election comisison needs to verify the citizen at the time of voting process. This solves the problem where there are many people living in the Citizens whose roots are somewhere in the rural areas this solves the problem where the citizens can actually turn out to vote where the participation would be turned to be high. 

## The voting process 
All the registered voters can either go to the polling station or through their smartphones. In order to vote online they need to verify their fingerprint using their smartphone and their Aaadhar number. This would be sent to the Matdaankendra block chain to fetch the electoral details in the voter's constituency. In case of the polling station there would be a polling agent will help to verify the details of the voter by using the smart contract which takes the Aadhar number and the fingerprint of the voter. Then depending on the constituency where the voter is registered the electoral details would be dispalyed where he can cast his vote for the desired candidate.

## Bursting the hacking accusation
Whenever a vote is casted a transaction is generated on the blockchain. The transaction contains a mixture of public and private fields. The voter can see all the details on his transaction i.e., to whom he has casted his vote. Once the transaction is published on the block chain all the citizens can view fields like the candidate to whom the vote has been casted. The details of the voter will be hidden. The published transaction will have a hash which the voter can match to ensure that his vote has been counted. The Matdaankendra has nodes which regularly publishes the blocks containing the transactions on the blockchain.

## Expedite Vote Counting and tallying

As the Matdaankendra regularly publishes the blocks on the blockchain, so it can keep tab on the number of votes casted to a candidate. It also can keep a track of the block numbers and the merkel tree path data of the vote on the blockchain which can be used to tally the vote couting.

## Helping people to choose better representatives 

In order to help people to choose better representatives the election manifesto can be put on the blockchain. A poll would be raised constitutency wise which would be voted by the citizen which would show percentage of the people who are satifisfied by the services provided by the candidate. Which would give more informed choice to the citizens.
